## UI Hierarchy

*The React components hierarchy*

## State Representation

*To decide what will be a state, these are the guidelines to decide:*

1. *The data changes over time*
2. *The data is not passed via props*
3. *The data is not computed based on existing state or props*

## Conditionals for each function

*Identify edge cases for each feature*
